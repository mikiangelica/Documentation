**AWS LAB Project**
The purpose of this project is to have hands on practice with AWS for better understanding and exposure to Cloud and AWS infrastructure and its inner workings.

In this LAB, the use case will be adopting AWS cloud services for a company's ecommerce website to allow for scalability as the business grows. Low latency and accessibility are also considered here in the choosing of AWS to host our webapp.

Below is a diagram of the cloud infrastructure
